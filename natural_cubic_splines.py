def get_natural_cubic_spline_model(x, y, minval=None, maxval=None, n_knots=None, knots=None):
    """
    Get a natural cubic spline model for the data.

    For the knots, give (a) `knots` (as an array) or (b) minval, maxval and n_knots.

    If the knots are not directly specified, the resulting knots are equally
    space within the *interior* of (max, min).  That is, the endpoints are
    *not* included as knots.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: np.array of float
        The input data
    y: np.array of float
        The outpur data
    minval: float
        Minimum of interval containing the knots.
    maxval: float
        Maximum of the interval containing the knots.
    n_knots: positive integer
        The number of knots to create.
    knots: array or list of floats
        The knots.

    Returns
    --------
    model: a model object
        The returned model will have following method:
        - predict(x):
            x is a numpy array. This will return the predicted y-values.

    The features created with this basis expansion can be used to fit a

    differentiable to the second order at all of the knots.
    This transformer can be created in two ways:
      - By specifying the maximum, minimum, and number of knots.
      - By specifying the cutpoints directly.
